# Simplified Regex Class with Method Chaining

This is a C++ class that provides a simplified way for building regular expression patterns using method chaining. The class is designed to make it easy to create regular expression patterns for common use cases without having to worry about the syntax of regular expressions. **This is in no way a complete implementation of this idea.** This is just a proof of concept/ something I did for fun.

## Adding patterns

To make a regex patter you have to declare a new SimplerRegex variable.
After that you chain up different function to add onto the regex.
